# Getting And Cleaning Data

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Repository Struction

- directory /project_data, contains all files needed for evaluation by run_analysis.R
- README.md, this file.
- Codebook.md, contains the description of variables produced by run_analysis.R
- run_analysis.R, is the R script that produces the tidyData.txt file
- TidyData.txt, is the file generated by run_analysis.R, which contains the reshaped data set processed from /project_data
